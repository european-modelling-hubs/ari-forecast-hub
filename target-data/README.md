# Target Data
This `target-data` folder contains the ground truth information about ARI incidence in EU/EEA countries extracted from [ERVISS](https://erviss.org/) and [FluID](https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/surveillance-and-monitoring/fluid). 

The [latest file](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/ari-forecast-hub/blob/main/target-data/latest-ARI_incidence.csv) reports latest data merged from the two data sources.

In particular, the countries are divided into the two data sources as follows:

| Data Source | Countries (ISO-2 code) |
| -------- | -------- |
| ERVISS | AT, BE, HR, CZ, DK, EE, FI, FR, GR, HU, IS, IE, IT, LV, LT, LU, MT, NL, NO, PL, PT, RO, SK, SI|
| FluID | GB-ENG, GB-WLS, GB-NIR, GB-SCT |
